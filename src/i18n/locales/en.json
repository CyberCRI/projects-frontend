      "des": "In any organization with more than twenty members, it's hard to know who does what and what anyone's working on right now. We started Projects to let {link} users share their projects and initiatives between students, researchers, staff members and teachers.",
      "des1": "In an interdisciplinary environment, you cannot rely on top-down communication only : people need to talk, to discover other projects relevant to their work, to be inspired by cool projects that make sense for themselves and the planet. So we built a platform to let anyone display his/her own projects and passions to their community and to the world.",
      "des2": "It was soon obvious that ANY organization has similar needs. So we let other groups share their own projects (NGOs, universities...) on their own portals, while all projects where shared on a {link}. We got the support of the French Ministry of Education, the City of Paris, the Île-de-France Region, the Université de Paris and many others.",
